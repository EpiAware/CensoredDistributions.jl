# picked by passing the single delay or the `Convolved` chain total, and the
# δ-bounded window adds `lower = upper - δ`. The helpers below thread the
# observation horizon through and add the AD-safe empty-support clamp and
# δ-bounded normaliser the bare `truncated` does not.

# Right-truncate `dist` at `window`. Upper-only: no lower bound is added, so
# the log-normaliser is exactly the right-truncation term `-logcdf(dist,
# window)` and AD never differentiates `logcdf(dist, minimum(dist))` (which is
# `-Inf` for e.g. a LogNormal index delay, giving a NaN gradient). A
# non-positive window (the horizon has passed the anchor) clamps to the
# distribution's minimum, giving an empty-support truncation that matches the
