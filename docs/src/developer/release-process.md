# [Release Process](@id release-process)

CensoredDistributions.jl follows a hybrid approach to release documentation,
combining the Julia ecosystem's standard practices with a news file for major releases.

## Release Philosophy

- **Release frequently**: Ideally after every merged PR to main.
- **Semantic versioning**: Follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) strictly
- **Hybrid changelog approach**: Use NEWS.md for major releases, GitHub
  releases for all releases
- **Automated tooling**: Leverage standard Julia ecosystem tools
- **SciML ecosystem alignment**: Follow established patterns from the
  broader scientific computing ecosystem

**When NOT to release**:
- Work-in-progress features
- Failing tests
- Incomplete documentation for new features
- During Julia ecosystem-wide changes (wait for stability)

## Release Workflow

### 1. Standard Julia Tooling

We use the same tools as major Julia packages:

- **CompatHelper**: Automated dependency updates via daily PRs
- **@JuliaRegistrator**: Manual package registration to Julia General Registry
- **TagBot**: Automated GitHub release creation after registry registration

### 2. Release Steps

#### For Regular Releases (Patch/Minor)

1. **Ensure all tests pass** and pre-commit hooks are clean
2. **Update version** in `Project.toml`:
   ```toml
   version = "1.2.3"  # Follow semantic versioning
   ```
3. **Commit and merge** to main via PR
4. **Trigger registration** by commenting on the merge commit:
   ```
   @JuliaRegistrator register
   ```
5. **Automated flow**:
   - JuliaRegistrator creates PR to Julia General Registry
   - Once merged (~15 minutes), TagBot automatically creates GitHub release
   - Documentation is automatically deployed for new tagged versions

#### For Major Releases (Breaking Changes)

1. **Plan breaking changes** carefully with issue discussion
2. **Create NEWS.md entry** following the template above:
   - Document all breaking changes with before/after examples
   - Provide comprehensive migration guidance
   - Include rationale for major changes
   - Acknowledge significant contributors
3. **Update version** with major version bump (e.g., `1.5.2` → `2.0.0`)
4. **Follow same registration process** as regular releases
5. **Consider deprecation warnings** in the previous minor release

**Additional Major Release Considerations**:
- Create migration documentation or guides if needed
- Update tutorials and examples to reflect new API
- Coordinate with downstream packages that depend on CensoredDistributions.jl
- Consider advance communication to user community via Julia Discourse or
  GitHub Discussions

### 3. Semantic Versioning Guidelines

Following [SemVer](https://semver.org/):

- **Patch** (`1.0.0` → `1.0.1`): Bug fixes, performance improvements
- **Minor** (`1.0.1` → `1.1.0`): New features, additions to API (backwards
  compatible)
- **Major** (`1.1.0` → `2.0.0`): Breaking changes to public API

#### Examples:
- Adding new distribution types: **Minor**
- Fixing calculation bugs: **Patch**
- Changing function signatures: **Major**
- Adding optional parameters: **Minor**
- Removing deprecated functions: **Major**

### 4. Release Notes and Changelog Strategy

We use a **hybrid changelog approach** that combines the strengths of both
traditional NEWS.md files and GitHub releases:

#### Changelog Hierarchy

1. **GitHub Releases**: Used for all releases (patch, minor, and major)
   - Automatically generated by TagBo
   - Provides immediate visibility in the Julia ecosystem
   - Links to commits and PRs for detailed change tracking

2. **NEWS.md**: Used for major releases and significant milestones
   - Provides comprehensive context for breaking changes
   - Offers detailed migration guidance
   - Follows SciML ecosystem conventions for major version documentation

#### Templates

##### Release Documentation Strategy

**GitHub Releases (Minor/Patch - Automated)**:
- GitHub automatically generates release notes for minor and patch releases
- Uses commit messages and PR labels to categorise changes
- No manual intervention required

**NEWS.md Entries (Major Releases - Manual)**:
- Maintainers manually write detailed entries for major releases
- Focus on breaking changes, migration guidance, and significant features
- Provide context
- Follow a structured format with breaking changes, new features, and migration examples

##### NEWS.md Entry Template (Major Releases):
```markdown
# CensoredDistributions.jl v2.0.0

## Breaking Changes

### API Restructuring
The distribution constructor API has been simplified and standardised:

**Before (v1.x)**:
```julia
d = PrimaryCensored(delay_dist, primary_dist, censoring_window)
```

**After (v2.0)**:
```julia
d = primary_censored(delay_dist, primary_dist; window=censoring_window)
```

## New Features
- Unified distribution constructor interface
- Enhanced integration with Turing.jl v0.30+
- Support for arbitrary primary event distributions

## Performance Improvements
- 3x faster PDF calculations for common distribution pairs
- Reduced memory allocation in vectorised operations

## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to @contributor1, @contributor2 for major contributions to this
release.
```

### 5. Automation Details

#### CompatHelper
- Runs daily via GitHub Actions (`CompatHelper.yaml`)
- Automatically updates `[compat]` entries in `Project.toml`
- Creates PRs for dependency version bumps
- Helps maintain up-to-date dependencies across Julia ecosystem

#### TagBot
- Triggered when package appears in Julia General Registry
- Automatically creates GitHub releases with generated changelog
- Uses SSH key (`DOCUMENTER_KEY`) for authenticated operations
- Supports custom release notes if provided

#### Version Management Actions

- Runs automatically on pushes to main checking for version changes in Project.toml
- Accepts /version major|minor|patch comments on PRs from users with write permissions
- Creates patch increment PRs for main branch or commits directly to PR branches

#### JuliaRegistrator
- Community bot for registering packages
- Only package collaborators can trigger registration
- Validates package before creating registry PR
- Usually completes registration within 15 minutes

### 7. Pre-Release Checklis

Before triggering `@JuliaRegistrator register`:

**For All Releases**:
- [ ] All CI tests pass (including pre-commit hooks)
- [ ] Version number follows semantic versioning
- [ ] New features have tests and documentation
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date (check CompatHelper PRs)
- [ ] Examples in docstrings work correctly

**Additional Checklist for Major Releases**:
- [ ] NEWS.md entry created following template
- [ ] Breaking changes documented with migration examples
- [ ] Deprecation warnings added in previous releases (where applicable)
- [ ] Migration guide or documentation updated
- [ ] Downstream package compatibility assessed
- [ ] Community communication planned (if needed)

### 8. Emergency Releases

For critical bug fixes:

1. **Create hotfix branch** from latest release tag
2. **Apply minimal fix** with tests
3. **Bump patch version** immediately
4. **Fast-track PR review** and merge
5. **Register immediately** with `@JuliaRegistrator register`

### 9. Coordinating with Julia Ecosystem

#### Registry Compatibility
- Monitor Julia ecosystem releases affecting dependencies
- Test against Julia LTS, stable, and pre-release versions in CI
- Follow Julia deprecation cycles

#### Documentation Releases
- Major releases trigger documentation rebuilds automatically
- Ensure tutorials work with new versions
- Update installation instructions if Julia version requirements change

### 10. Troubleshooting Releases

#### Common Issues:
- **Registry PR fails**: Check Project.toml syntax and version conflicts
- **TagBot doesn't trigger**: Verify `DOCUMENTER_KEY` secret is configured
- **Tests fail after release**: Emergency patch release procedure

#### Getting Help:
- Check [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) for registry issues
- SciML community practices for guidance
- GitHub Issues for package-specific problems

This process ensures reliable, frequent releases while maintaining high
quality and ecosystem compatibility.
